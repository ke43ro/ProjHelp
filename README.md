Projection helper (ProjHelp) is a Windows application to assist someone using a data projector.

It will manage a collection of PowerPoint files (intended to be song lyrics) using user-created playlists that are time stamped as well as named for easy recall.
ProjHelp detects the secondary screen and projects to that screen (if the PC's Projection is set to Extend)

It is also possible to add arbitrary files to the playlists.  These can include PDF, DOC, DOCX and a collection of video formats as well as PowerPoint files.
